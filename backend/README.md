# Backend

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

If you're running the project locally, you can access the backend by navigating to [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
